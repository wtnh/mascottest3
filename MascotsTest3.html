		<div>This very unusual mascot depicts the head of a jester (possibly the popular character Punch) perched atop a globe.  All of the continents and oceans are correctly imprinted on the globe, and it is stamped with the words “Always on Top”.  The globe is mounted on an inverted radiator cap attached to the upper part of a small piston.

		<div>The Bentley insignia was first introduced by brothers W.O. and H.M. Bentley in 1920.  After the Rolls-Royce take-over of Bentley in 1931, Charles Sykes, the creator of the iconic Spirit of Ecstasy mascot, submitted a number of designs including this one.  Subsequently, in 1935, Bentley held a competition for a new design, offering a prize of ₤50 to the winner.  At the end of the competition, Bentley decreed that “nothing sufficiently outstanding was entered”, so instead of adopting a new design, two consolation prizes of ₤25 each were awarded.  Flying B mascots that retract into the grille of todays Bentley bonnets are still available as a distinctive accessory.

		<div>In 1927, master glassmaker René Lalique (1860 – 1945) began creating radiator art in the form of beautifully streamlined animals and sensuous female figures.  These crystal creations were coveted by those privileged few who could afford luxury automobiles and the high-priced artwork to adorn them.  This clear crystal rooster could be affixed to the hood of the car utilizing a special fitting designed to illuminate the mascot with an interchangeable light filter.  The night time effect was stunning!
</div>
		<div>Coc Nain</div>
		<div>This stylized eagle is made of a hollow cast alloy and is finished in both silver plate and thin pale blue enamel.  It was manufactured in Germany and is signed “Jarle.”

		<div>This mascot is marked “H R”, and was sold in UK by shops such as Finnigans of London.  This superb piece was manufactured in France and depicts Mercury the Winged Messenger wearing a helmet and goggles and staring pensively into the distance.  Finnigans (“When in doubt go to Finnigans”) sold a wide variety of goods including portmanteaus, cigarette cases, leather goods, sea side baskets, and accessories for the motoring public.

</div>
		<div>Speed God</div>
		<div>This whimsical bear is holding the symbol for AC Automobiles, an early British marque.  Originally founded in 1901 by John Weller under the name Autocar & Accessories Limited, the company unveiled their Autocar at the 1903 British Motor Show.   Available in either a twin-cylinder 10 hp or a four-cylinder 20 hp configuration, Weller’s entry received accolades: “We foresee a brilliant future for the Weller Autocar and its talented designer.” Autocar & Accessories later became Autocarrier and then simply AC.  The AC symbol was first used in 1915.  Today, over 100 years later, AC continues to produce high performance automobiles, making it one of the oldest independent car makers in Britain.

</div>
		<div>Bear</div>
		<div>Windswept</div>
		<div>Beautiful women with long flowing gowns were popular subjects for automotive mascots.  This fine example depicts a maiden with her hair and gown swept back by the powerful winds created as the automobile upon which she stands speeds along.  It was manufactured circa 1920, and is made of brass with a chromium finish.

</div>
		<div>Motor cars in the 1920’s and 30’s sported radiator caps with a bolt fitting designed to serve as a mount for a “mascot” – a symbol of the owner’s individuality.  Renowned artist René Lalique (1860 – 1945) seized upon the opportunity to create beautiful mascots in glass.  This example is fitted onto a special base allowing it to be wired in such a way that a multicolored filter illuminated the falcon in colors of red, blue, green, amber or mauve; creating a stunning effect at night.  Lalique mascots demanded a high price – perfect for the discriminating automobile owner who wished to distinguish his car from others making it uniquely his own.
</div>
		<div>Falcon</div>
		<div>This rare Francois Bazin design was issued as a factory option (costing only $37.50) for those lucky enough to purchase the extraordinary Duesenberg.  Pegasus was also available for purchase through mail order catalogues such as Nil Melior and Tanquary.  According to the Tanquary Catalogue, “Pegasus was the winged horse of the Gods of Mt. Olympus.  Born of the Sea foam and the blood of Medusa.”
</div>

		<div>In 1925, Stutz launched their “Safety Stutz” models which featured longer, lower body styles, a low center of gravity, and safety features like shatter resistant glass built into the bodies.  Seeking a symbol of strength and security, they chose Ra the Sun God as their figurehead.  The Stutz Ra wears a Neo-Egyptian winged helmet surmounted by a falcon.  All Stutz cars were delivered with this mascot unless otherwise requested until the mid-1930s.
